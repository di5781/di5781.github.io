                                As a key person in this project, I designed and developed a web database application for incident tracking, inventory management and CRM using Java, Spring, and MySQL.
                                It includes:  
                                <ul>

                                Sale. This project used a better way to connect a PO and Receiving to Shipping and
                                delivery with vendor payments in one step. So, it reduced the time lag for payments to
                                the vendors. It included Local PO and No invoice PO receiving with the shipping delivery
                                information.

                                rental, refunds, buy out, check in and extend the rental. It also includes collateral
                                information for financial guarantee and penalty rules for overdue and damaged items. All
                                the sales and collateral information is posted to financial management systems with real
                                time communication updates(using EDI). Inventory control system will get updated at

                                As a key person in this project, I designed and developed this functionality in POS. The function of this program  is to sell AppleCare warranties with the hardware provided from Apple in the campuses. When the AppleCare warranty was sold, and the customer information collected along with the Apple item sold this was posted to Apple's database in real time. POS was able to provide the warranty agreement number on the customersâ€™ receipt.  Functionality was also included to allow for return/refund of the warranty in real time that updated Apple as well as POS and accounting.

                                project is to better serve the customers for School AR accounts and FA accounts. It means
                                that some AR or FA accounts can only pay for certain items. This program communicates
                                with school financial management system to get proof that the item(s) can be sold to this
                                student. So, the school doesn't need to reconsolidate all the AR or FA tenders. It helps
                                schools easily manage their accounts.

Using http requests to send client input data to the controllers and controllers to processing the data; uploaded the responses data to the Thymeleaf templates to display the results of the requests. In this web application, you can create a topic and add multiple posts under the topic. You also can hashtag any post you want.

You can play one click at a time. When you have enough donuts, you can buy multipliers or auto-click. It was a fun game.

                                This project was a Music Album and songs Collection Web Application. We used JavaScript as the frontend and Spring Boot MVC as the backend. In the back end we were utilizing Restful API in Spring Boot. We used MVC concepts and using Restful controllers for processing and updating the response data to the frontend. We used JavaScript as the frontend tool to achieve single page web application with multiple views. You can create an album, and create songs in this album; update the titles and delete the album and songs.

                                The project goal was to use principles of OOP (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism). I designed to use abstract classes and interfaces to achieve these goals; and, implement this project successfully. In my Virtual Pet Center (only dogs and cats), you can adopt and receive a pet (live or robot); you can take the pet for a walk (only dogs); you can feed them (food or water). You can check status of the pets to determine what actions you need to take (like â€“ feed, give water or need to see a vet).
