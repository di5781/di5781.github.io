                                As a key person in this project, I designed and developed a web database application for incident tracking, inventory management and CRM using Java, Spring, and MySQL.
                                It includes:  
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Customer Information</li>

                                As a key person in this project, I designed and developed this functionality in Point Of
                                Sale. This project used a better way to connect a PO and Receiving to Shipping and
                                delivery with vendor payments in one step. So, it reduced the time lag for payments to
                                the vendors. It included Local PO and No invoice PO receiving with the shipping delivery
                                information.

                                Students can rent the books at school and return the books at school. As a key person
                                on the project, I designed and developed this function in POS. It included book
                                rental, refunds, buy out, check in and extend the rental. It also includes collateral
                                information for financial guarantee and penalty rules for overdue and damaged items. All
                                the sales and collateral information is posted to financial management systems with real
                                time communication updates(using EDI). Inventory control system will get updated at
                                store closing.

                            <p>
                                As a key person in this project, I designed and developed this functionality in
                                POS. The function of this program is to sell all the AppleCare warranties with the
                                hardware provided from Apple in the campuses. It functioned in real time. When
                                the AppleCare warranty was sold, and the customer information collected along with the Apple item will be posted to Apple's database in real time. Apple will create warranty agreement number pass back to POS. POS will print this number on the customers’ receipt. Also, it
                                will create a non-receiving PO for this warranty and pass onto financial management
                                system. So, Apple will get the payment. If it is an AppleCare warranty refunded, POS
                                will take the refund from the register; and post a cancellation of the warranty with the
                                original purchase transaction to Apple. At the same time, POS will create a Return to
                                Vender through Accounting Receiving and Payable system to Apple. All the information
                                will be displayed on Apple's ePortal in real time.

                            <p>
                                As a team member on this project, I developed this functionality in POS. This
                                project is to better serve the customers for School AR accounts and FA accounts. It means
                                that some AR or FA accounts can only pay for certain items. This program communicates
                                with school financial management system to get proof that the item(s) can be sold to this
                                student. So, the school doesn't need to reconsolidate all the AR or FA tenders. It helps
                                schools easily manage their accounts.
